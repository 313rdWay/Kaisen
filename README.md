# Kaisen

Kaisen was developed by Team Kaisen at the MSU Apple Developer Academy as part of a challenge to create an app that solves a real problem for a fellow cohort member. Our user, a Game Developer, struggled with time management, staying focused, and occasionally finding motivation. To address these challenges, we created Kaisen—a gamified task tracker that combines time management and motivation tools into one seamless experience.

## Acknowledgements

I’d like to express my gratitude to the incredible team I had the pleasure of working with on this project. Together, we created an amazing app and a meaningful experience for our user! Despite the fast-paced nature of the challenge, the journey was both rewarding and fun.


## Lessons Learned

Through this challenge, I gained valuable hands-on experience with MVVM. While I had previously learned about Model, View, and ViewModel, this was my first time fully incorporating the organizational pattern into a project—and it was by far the best decision I could have made. MVVM made updating the project significantly easier and even streamlined file navigation. My code felt concise, readable, and approachable, which I hope any developer reviewing it would appreciate.
