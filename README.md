# Kaisen

Kaisen was developed by Team Kaisen at the MSU Apple Developer Academy, where we were instructed to create an app that solves a problem for another member of our cohort. Our user was a Game Developer, who had problems with time management, focus, and occassionally motivation. So Kaisen was personally made as a gamified task tracker, time managenent, and motivation applications all in one.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank and and acknowledge the wonderful team I had the pleasure of working on this project with and creating an amazing app and experience for our user! This experience was very fun even in its fast paced form.


## Lessons Learned

I learned a lot about MVVM this challenge. I previously learned about Model, View, and ViewModel but this is my first time incorporating the orginzational style in one of my project and its by far the best descision that I could have made. MVVM made everything so much easier to work with when i needed to update things in the project and even when it came to trying to find files in my project. All of my code felt short, readable, and approachable...I hope to any developer who would review over it.
